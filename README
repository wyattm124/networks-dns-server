This folder contains the files needed to make a python3 DNS server. Note that to run this server, you will need python3 and the library DNSlib for python3.

For testing, I used the "Vagrantfile" and the "pseudoVagrant" executable to create VM to run the server in. I was running Ubuntu 18.04 and at the time there was a problem with syncing files to a Linux VM from a Ubuntu 18.04 host, so I had to find a Vagrantfile accompanied by the appropriate executable to be able to transfer files from my host to the VM. To test any Linux VM that can run python3 should be fine.

CDNZones is the zone file for the Fall 2019 CS1680 final project, and myZone is a sample Zonefile I used for testing.

The python3 file for the server is randResolver.py, and it can be run with the simple bash script startDNS.

If you want to run the DNS server as a service, you can use systemd on a Linux machine. the Unit file for the server is randDNS.
